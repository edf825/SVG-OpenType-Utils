This program takes a TrueType font and an SVG document, and outputs a new font
with the SVG document in its 'SVG ' table and all the old font information.

Try:
./insertsvg LiberationSerif-Regular.ttf circles.xml out.ttf

Then use in the latest Firefox with all the patches from Bug 719286 applied, and
the gfx.font_rendering.opentype_svg.enabled option set to `true'.

Included is a file named `test.html'. Hopefully that should work.

I can only apologise for the quality of code.
